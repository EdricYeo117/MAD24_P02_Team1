## Introduction:
- Hello, we are Group 1 from the MAD Module for Software Engineering Specialisation under Information Technology (N54).
This repository is for our assignment.
Our overall idea for our application is a food recipe app.

### Objective:
- Our app is designed to empower health conscious individuals to make informed decisions on their diet and consistently plan out their meals at their convenience through the app
- It will achieve this through 3 main goals
1) Providing recipes with information provided on ingredients required to prepare it, leading to users being eased in to cooking their own meals rather than opting for takeout
2) Providing avenues for users to plan their meals, enabling them to structure their meals according to their needs and dietary requirements (such as specific dietary restrictions or intolerances)
3) Providing systems for users to manage track their ingredients to be able to conveniently plan out meals, further leading to a paradigm shift in their lifestyle to incorporate meal planning into their daily routine.

### Motivation:
Due to rising obesity in Singapore, from 10.5% in 2019-2020, to 11.6% in 2021/22 done by the [National Population Health Survey] (https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/its-not-a-small-world-after-all#:~:text=Based%20on%20the%202021%2F2022,increase%20in%20obesity%20rates%20observed.) With 11.9% to 13.1% in males and 9.3% to 10.2%, with the highest disparity amongst elders from aged 40-49 at 15.0%. The two predominant factors are Exercise, Nutrition. 
Therefore our group has decided on the nutrition factor, to give users the ability to properly plan out meals and select recipes, lowering the barrier of entry to home-cooking.
